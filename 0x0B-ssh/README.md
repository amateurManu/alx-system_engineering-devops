SSH

This directory serves as a deepdive into accessing remote machines through the Secure Shell(SSH) as learnt in the ALX SE Program. The project covers how transmitted data is encrypted over networks using SSH, generating SSH RSA key pair, different services offered by server instances.

Editor used is vi and all files are interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. All Bash script files are executable.


Tasks:

0. Use a private key
mandatory
Write a Bash script that uses ssh to connect to your server using the private key ~/.ssh/school with the user ubuntu.

Requirements:

Only use ssh single-character flags
You cannot use -l
You do not need to handle the case of a private key protected by a passphrase


1. Create an SSH key pair
mandatory
Write a Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.

Requirements:

Name of the created private key must be school
Number of bits in the created key to be created 4096
The created key must be protected by the passphrase betty


2. Client configuration file
mandatory
Your machine has an SSH configuration file for the local SSH client, letâ€™s configure it to our needs so that you can connect to a server without typing a password. Share your SSH client configuration in your answer file.

Requirements:

Your SSH client configuration must be configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/school
Your SSH client configuration must be configured to refuse to authenticate using a password
