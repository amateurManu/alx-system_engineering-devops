# Application Server

In this project, our flask application from [AirBnB_clone_v2](https://github.com/amateurManu/AirBnB_clone_v2.git) will be served with Gunicorn and Nginx on Ubuntu 16.04.(Gunicorn is installed globally and not using `virtualenv`)

Everything Python-related is done using `python3`

## Bash Scripts

All files are interpreted on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
All scripts are executable (`chmod u+x filename`)
All scripts pass `Shellcheck` (version `0.3.7-5~ubuntu16.04.1` via `apt-get`) without errors
